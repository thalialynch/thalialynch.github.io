 <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"> This is a page about my family. I have a big family that I am very close with. I see my cousins and grandparents pretty much every weekend when I lived at home, they are always at my house. When ever I go home I try and see them as much as possible. I also facetime my Grandma and my brother all the time because I miss them a lot.</p>
