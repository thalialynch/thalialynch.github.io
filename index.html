 <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"> I am currently a student at the Universtiy of Maine, I am a first year student majoring in business.
 I love animals, going shopping, and spending time with friends and family. I come from a town where everyone pretty much knows each other and grew up hanging out with my friends everyday, we are pratically family. On my website you will see pictures of my friends, family, and even my new puppy! I love to listen to music, drive arounf and watch the pats. The town I live in is about 40 minutes outside of Boston, I love to go shopping in boston and try cool new food places.</p>
